    "# Analyzing the Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will analyze the effectiveness of the prompt designed to extract detailed information from a graph image and generate JSON files compatible with Plotly. The analysis will focus on how well the prompt adheres to principles of clear and specific instructions and provides a logical step-by-step approach. We will also demonstrate the strength of the prompt using examples.\n",

    "## The Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by reviewing the given prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Task: Extract detailed information from a given graph image and generate JSON files (data.json, layout.json, and config.json) compatible with Plotly. Use the specified delimiters to wrap each JSON section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify and categorize the plot types present in the graph (e.g., line, scatter, bar, pie).\n",
    "2. Extract the data points for each plot (x-values, y-values, and any other relevant data such as labels for pie charts).\n",
    "3. Note any multiple plots on the same figure and their configurations.\n",
    "4. Verify that no data points or plots are missing from the extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate data.json:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each plot, include details such as:\n",
    "- \"type\": The type of plot (e.g., scatter, bar, pie).\n",
    "- \"x\" and \"y\": Arrays of data points for the x and y axes.\n",
    "- \"labels\" and \"values\": For pie charts.\n",
    "- \"mode\": For line and scatter plots (e.g., markers, lines, or markers+lines).\n",
    "- \"name\": Legend entry for the plot.\n",
    "- \"marker\": Properties such as color, size, and symbol for markers.\n",
    "- \"line\": Properties such as color, width, and dash style for lines.\n",
    "- \"text\": Hover text for each data point.\n",
    "- \"hoverinfo\": Information displayed on hover (e.g., x+y+text).\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate layout.json:\n",
    "\n",
    "Include details such as:\n",
    "- \"title\": The title of the graph, including text, font properties (family, size, color).\n",
    "- \"xaxis\" and \"yaxis\": Configuration including title, range, showgrid, gridcolor, zeroline, zerolinecolor, showticklabels, tickangle, tickfont.\n",
    "- \"legend\": Properties including orientation, x, y, xanchor, font.\n",
    "- \"margin\": Values for l (left), r (right), b (bottom), t (top), pad.\n",
    "- \"plot_bgcolor\" and \"paper_bgcolor\": Background colors of the plot area and paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate config.json:\n",
    "\n",
    "Include configuration settings such as:\n",
    "- \"responsive\": Whether the graph is responsive (boolean).\n",
    "- \"displayModeBar\": Whether the mode bar is displayed (boolean).\n",
    "- \"modeBarButtonsToRemove\": List of mode bar buttons to remove (e.g., [\"toImage\"]).\n",
    "- \"scrollZoom\": Whether scrolling zoom is enabled (boolean).\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrap each JSON output in specific XML-like tags:\n",
    "- <data> ... </data>\n",
    "- <layout> ... </layout>\n",
    "- <config> ... </config>\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to follow the JSON formatting guidelines:\n",
    "- Double Quotes for Keys and Strings: Ensure that all keys and string values in JSON are enclosed in double quotes (\").\n",
    "  Example: Instead of \"type\": bar, it should be \"type\": \"bar\".\n",
    "- No Trailing Commas: Remove any trailing commas after the last element in arrays ([]) or objects ({}).\n",
    "  Example: Instead of \"color\": \"rgba(55, 128, 191, 0.6)\",, it should be \"color\": \"rgba(55, 128, 191, 0.6)\"\n",

    "\n",
    "## Principles Followed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle 1: Write Clear and Specific Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clarity and Specificity**:\n",
    "   - The prompt clearly outlines the task: extracting information from a graph image and generating JSON files. \n",
    "   - It specifies each step in the process, from identifying plot types to extracting data points and generating configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use of Delimiters (Tactic 1)**:\n",
    "   - The prompt uses `<data>`, `<layout>`, and `<config>` tags to wrap each JSON section, which helps separate the output into distinct, manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Structured Output (Tactic 2)**:\n",
    "   - The prompt requests the output in a structured JSON format, detailing the required elements for `data.json`, `layout.json`, and `config.json`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Checking Conditions (Tactic 3)**:\n",
    "   - The prompt includes formatting guidelines to ensure JSON validity, such as using double quotes and avoiding trailing commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Few-shot Prompting (Tactic 4)**:\n",
    "   - It provides a detailed example output for each JSON file, guiding the model in producing consistent and accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principle 2: Give the Model Time to “Think”\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step-by-Step Process (Tactic 1)**:\n",
    "   - The prompt lays out a step-by-step process for analyzing the graph and generating the JSON files, helping the model address each aspect systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encouraging Thoughtfulness (Tactic 2)**:\n",
    "   - By detailing the types of data and configurations needed, the prompt encourages a thorough analysis of the graph before generating the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Analysis of Each Section\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze each section of the prompt in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Analysis Section\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Graph Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify and categorize the plot types present in the graph (e.g., line, scatter, bar, pie).\n",
    "2. Extract the data points for each plot (x-values, y-values, and any other relevant data such as labels for pie charts).\n",
    "3. Note any multiple plots on the same figure and their configurations.\n",
    "4. Verify that no data points or plots are missing from the extraction.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identifying Plot Types**:\n",
    "  - This step ensures that the model correctly identifies each plot type present in the graph, which is crucial for generating accurate JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extracting Data Points**:\n",
    "  - The instruction to extract x-values, y-values, and other relevant data ensures that the JSON files will include all necessary data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Multiple Plots**:\n",
    "  - By noting multiple plots and their configurations, the prompt ensures that the model can handle complex graphs with multiple data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Verification**:\n",
    "  - The verification step helps to ensure that all data points and plots are included, adding a layer of thoroughness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### data.json Section\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "For each plot, include details such as:\n",
    "- \"type\": The type of plot (e.g., scatter, bar, pie).\n",
    "- \"x\" and \"y\": Arrays of data points for the x and y axes.\n",
    "- \"labels\" and \"values\": For pie charts.\n",
    "- \"mode\": For line and scatter plots"
