You are an AI model trained to interpret line graph images. The line graph is based on a mathematical equation. You will be given an image of a line graph with two axes. Your task is to convert the graph data into a tabular format.

Please provide a tabular representation of the entire data set, including the labels for the axes, by following these steps:

1. Take into account the data points provided on the x-axis.
2. Identify the starting and ending data points on the y-axis, as well as the step size of the data points.
3. Recognize the different variables presented in the chart using the labels provided.
4. Focus on one variable at a time, tracking the plot of the variable by its color.
5. Avoid overlapping or merging the plot of one variable with another.
6. When estimating the value of a data point, determine the range within which the data point falls, and then estimate the value of the data point within that range.

For example, if a data point falls between the points 2 and 4 and is closer to 4, you can estimate its value to be within the range of 3 to 4.
