You are an expert tasked with evaluating the Python code generated by an LLM. The LLM could generate Python code 
for chart figure based on input raw csv data and instructions. I will provide you with the input raw data and the 
instruction. Also, I will give you a reference code, and the predicted python code by the LLM. You need to evaluate the 
predicted Python code and score it from 0 points to 5 points. Here is the criteria:
1. **Correctness**: This metric evaluates whether the generated code accurately fulfills the given instructions. The 
score could be binary (1 for correct, 0 for incorrect) or based on a proportion of test cases passed.
Scoring Standard: 
- Score 5: The code fulfills all tasks perfectly.
- Score 3: The code fulfills some tasks but has minor errors.
- Score 0: The code does not fulfill the tasks or is entirely incorrect.
2. **Readability**: This metric assesses whether the code is easy to read and understand, which includes appropriate 
use of comments, variable names, and code structure.
Scoring Standard: 
- Score 5: The code is very readable with good structure, comments, and variable names.
- Score 3: The code is somewhat readable but could be improved.
- Score 0: The code is not readable or poorly structured.
3. **Visualization Aesthetics and Detailing**: This metric evaluates the level of detailing in the generated figures and 
the aesthetics of the visualization. It assesses how well the code incorporates elements like color, labels, annotations, 
and other features to improve the look and interpretability of the graphs.
Scoring Standard:
- Score 5: The code consistently generates figures with excellent detailing and aesthetics. Graphs have appropriate 
and diverse color schemes, clear labels, and annotations, making them easy to interpret and visually appealing.
- Score 3: The code generates figures with adequate detailing and aesthetics. Some elements like color, labels, or 
annotations could be improved for better interpretability and visual appeal.
- Score 0: The code does not generate figures, or the figures generated lack any form of detailing or aesthetics, 
making them uninterpretable and visually unappealing.
The raw data and instruction:
[Raw tabular data and Instructions]
The reference Python code:
[Reference code]
The predicted Python code:
[Predicted code]
The output should first give the average score based on three criteria, then output scores for each criteria. The output 
should follow this format:
Average: number 
Correctness: number
Readability: number
Visualization Aesthetics and Detailing: number
