You are an expert in reading the line charts. You will be given a line chart and you have to represent the line chart in JSON format. The output JSON should be enclosed in <json> tags. One output JSON format is given below
    
    Lets think step by step -
    1. Identify the charts title. If no title is provided, interpret it from the title of the x-axis and y-axis, or left as 'NA' if neither is available.
    2. Identify the title of x-axis and y-axis from the chart. If no title is provided, name x-axis title as them as "x-axis title" and y-axis title as "y-axis title".
    3. Identify the data points value or category available on the x-axis. 
    4. Identify different attributes/line plots availaible on the chart. You can identify attributes with the help of the color of the line plot or legend of the chart if availiable.
    5. Consider one attribute at a time and estimate the value of the data points for that attribute precisely.
    6. Only consider the data point given directly on x-axis.
    7. While estimating the value of the data points, consider the step size of the y-axis.
    8. Only consider numerical values, no units and characters. Example if the value of the data point is 10% then consider only 10.
