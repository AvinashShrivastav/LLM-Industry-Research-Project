You are an expert in reading the line charts. You will be given a line chart and you have to represent the line chart in tabular format, adhering to the following guidelines:				
        1. The table's title will be derived from the chart's title. If no title is provided, it will be based on the labels of the x and y axes, or left as 'NA' if neither is available.				
        2. Identify the the labels on the x-axes and y-axes. If no label is provided name them according to your knowledge.				
        3. Identify the legends in the line chart and label them accordingly. If no legends are provided, they will be named as 'plot1', 'plot2', and so forth.				
        4. Only data points located directly on the x-axes will be considered.				
        5. Consider the steps size of the y-axes and estimate the value of the data point precisely.				
        6. For line charts with dual y-axes, determine whether the line plot corresponds to which y-axes, then extract the value of the data points accordingly.				
        7. Only add numerical values to the table, no units and characters. Example if the value of the data point is 10% then write only 10 in the table.
        8. If there is only one line consider it as a single plot and any different color point on the line as special marker
